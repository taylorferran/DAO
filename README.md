Here I'm learning how to create a DAO using solidity/hardhat for the backend and react for the frontend.

It's deployed on the rinkeby test network and can be seen here - building-a-dao-livid.vercel.app

If the user owns an NFT from the previous project built, they can have a say in which NFT the DAO should try and buy from the fake nft marketplace.

This is part of the learnweb3.io course.
